## How it works
This script will log into your ASU account and fill out the "none," "none" options on the survey completely hands free! You can even automate this script to run in the background of your computer (assuming that you're healthy). Minimal installation with some command line interface.

## Requirements
- Firefox browser (will add more browser support in the future)

  - Python libraries from the requirements package

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

## Disclosure
Please only use this script if you are 100% healthy and already know the answer is "none," "none" meaning that you have no symptoms and are feeling well. (Please don't sue me lol)
